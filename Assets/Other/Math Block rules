All about Math Blocks!
1. Each Math Block in the room must have it's own random value to display (eg: 52, 48, 24) 
2. A "solution" number must be created that can be created with a random combination of the math blocks (eg: 100)
3. Math blocks, when close to each other, need to add their values together. (52 + 48 = 100)
4. If the added values reach the "solution" number, the door is unlocked.

Generate solution
1. Take 2 random values from a list (make sure the same value can not be picked)
2. Add the values and store in a variable called 'solution'

Evaluate solution on collision
1. Detect which two blocks are colliding
2. Add the values together and compare it to the solution
3. If it matches the solution, open the exit.
4. If it doesn't match the solution, change the color of the blocks to red, freeze time, and restart the room.
